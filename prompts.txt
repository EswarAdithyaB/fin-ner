summarize each and every convo between us


Below is a clear, structured summary of every major conversation step between us, from start to now, focused on what you asked, what was decided, and why.

1️⃣ Initial Problem Definition

You wanted to build an NLP model to extract the following from natural-language financial statements:

Beneficiary name

From account

Amount

Payment type

Currency

📌 Key insight:
This is a financial Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem, not sentiment analysis or text classification.

2️⃣ Paper 1 – NER Survey Paper

You shared a NER survey paper and asked for explanation and validation.

Outcome:

NER is the correct foundational task

Rule-based → ML → Deep learning evolution

Financial domain needs custom entities

Transformers are best, but hybrid systems are industry-standard

📌 Decision:
NER with domain adaptation is required.

3️⃣ Paper 2 – Fine-Tuned Encoders vs ChatGPT

You shared a paper showing fine-tuned encoders outperform ChatGPT.

Outcome:

Domain-specific fine-tuning > generic LLM prompting

Data augmentation helps when data is limited

Sequence labeling models are better than generative LLMs for extraction

📌 Decision:
Use encoder-based NER, not prompt-based extraction.

4️⃣ Full Implementation Plan (Ideal Case)

You asked for a full implementation plan.

Outcome:

Transformer-based NER (RoBERTa / FinBERT) recommended

Custom entity schema designed

Hybrid system (ML + rules)

Evaluation strategy defined

📌 Decision:
RoBERTa-style NER is ideal if pretrained models are available.

5️⃣ FinBERT Sentiment Model Question

You asked if FinBERT sentiment analysis model is useful.

Outcome:

❌ Not useful for entity extraction

FinBERT sentiment outputs sentence-level polarity only

Can’t extract entities like amount or account

📌 Decision:
Do not use sentiment models for NER.

6️⃣ Model Comparison – RoBERTa vs spaCy vs LSTM

You requested a comparison.

Outcome:
Model	Verdict
RoBERTa	Best accuracy
spaCy	Fast, good with rules
LSTM	Outdated alone

📌 Decision:
RoBERTa best → fallback needed if unavailable.

7️⃣ Building RoBERTa from Scratch

You asked how to build RoBERTa from scratch.

Outcome:

Training from scratch requires huge compute & data

Not practical or necessary for your use case

Domain-adaptive training is the right approach

📌 Decision:
Do not train RoBERTa from scratch.

8️⃣ No Access to Pretrained Models – What to Do?

You said you don’t have access to pretrained models.

Outcome:

Best fallback: BiLSTM + CRF

Use FastText embeddings

Add rules for finance patterns

spaCy can help as a front-end

📌 Decision:
Use BiLSTM + CRF + spaCy features.

9️⃣ BiLSTM + CRF Architecture

You asked for the complete architecture.

Outcome:

Detailed layer-by-layer architecture provided

Why CRF is critical for BIO tagging

Training parameters & expected accuracy

📌 Decision:
BiLSTM + CRF is strong enough for finance NER.

🔟 Using spaCy with BiLSTM + CRF

You asked whether spaCy’s en_core_web_md can be used.

Outcome:

spaCy alone is weaker for custom finance entities

BiLSTM + CRF is more powerful

Best solution is a hybrid system

📌 Decision:
Combine spaCy + BiLSTM + CRF.

1️⃣1️⃣ Hybrid spaCy + BiLSTM + CRF Implementation

You asked for the complete hybrid implementation.

Outcome:

Full architecture

Feature engineering using spaCy vectors

Rule-based pre-tagging

CRF decoding

📌 Decision:
Hybrid architecture finalized.

1️⃣2️⃣ Single Python Script

You requested one runnable Python file.

Outcome:

End-to-end training + inference script

Uses spaCy embeddings

Trains BiLSTM + CRF

Works on CPU

📌 Decision:
You now have a runnable baseline system.

1️⃣3️⃣ 50k Annotated Dataset Question

You shared your annotation format using <START: X> … <END>.

Outcome:

Dataset is excellent

50k samples is more than sufficient

Requires conversion to BIO format

Conversion code provided

📌 Decision:
Your data is ideal for training this model.

🏁 Final Overall Conclusion
What you achieved:

✔ Correctly framed the problem
✔ Chose the right model given constraints
✔ Designed a production-ready architecture
✔ Have sufficient high-quality data
✔ Have working training code
